# The Internet

### An Overview
The internet is a Global network of interconnected cmoputers that communicate using standardized protocols. When information is sent across the internet it is broken down into packets. The packets are then sent to a router that, at which point, are forwarded to the next router, the process repeats until the packets reach their  destination.

- `Packet`: A small unit of data
- `Router`: A device that direts packets of data between networks
- `IP Address`: A unique identifier assigned to each device on a networks
- `Domain Name`: A human-readable name used to identify websites; "google.com"
- `DNS`: A system responsible for translating domain names into IP addresses
- `HTTP`: Hypertext Transfer Protocol, used to transfer data between a client (web browser) and a server (website)
- `HTTPS`: An encrypted version of HTTP used for security between client and server
- `SSL/TLS`: Secure Sockets Layer and Transport Layer Security, used to probide secure communication over the internet

### Internet Protocols
Internet protocols define how information is exchanged between devices, ensuring reliablility and security. Standardized protocols allows for the communication of different manufacturers and vendors. 
- `IP`: Internet Protocol, responsible for routing packets to correct destination
- `TCP/UDP`: Transmission Control Protocol and User Datagram Protocol, ensure packets are transmitted reliably and efficiently
- `DNS`: Domain Name System, used to translate domain names into IP addresses
- `HTTP`: Transfers data between clients and servers

* IP Addresses are computer-readable (192.168.1.1) Domain Names are human-readable (google.com), DNS translates Domain Names to IP Addresses.
* HTTP and HTTPS are both protocols used to transfer data between client and server, while the latter is a more secure version of the former (using SSL/TLS encryption). 
* TCP/IP is the most common communication protocol, and there are a few key concepts to understand:
	- `Ports`: Identifies the application or service running on the device
	- `Sockets`: Combination of IP address and port number
	- `Connections`: Established between two Sockets, the devices negotiate parameters of communication 
	- `Data Transfer`: Once a connection is established, data is transmitted in segments with each segment containing a sequence number and other metadata
* SSL/TLS is a protocol used to encrypt data transmitted over the internet, and there are a few key concepts to understand:
	- `Certificates`: Used to establish trust between client and server, contain information about server identity and are signed off by a trusted third party Certificate Authority to verify and establish trust
	- `Handshake`: Client and Server exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm for a secure conneciton
	- `Encryption`: Once a secure connection is established, data is encrypted using the agreed-upon algorithm, allowing secure data transfer between client and server
* Emerging Trends and Technologies are constantly being developed as the internet is ever-evolving. It is essential to stay up-to-date with the space to maintain the best security practices and protocols available.

### HTTP
HTTP is used to load pages on the internet using hyperlinks. HTTP is an application layer protocol and runs atop of the other layers of the netwrok protocol stack. 

An HTTP request is the way internet communications platforms, such as web browsers, ask for the information they need to load a website. A typical HTTP request contains:
- `HTTP method`: An HTTP method/verb specifies the action wanted from the queried server. 
- `HTTP request header`: Contain core information, such as the data being requested 
- `HTTP request body`: Portion of the request that contains information being submitted to the web server, such as username and password or any other data entered into a form. 

An HTTP response is what the web client recieves from an internet server, these responses contain valuable information based on what was requested. A typical HTTP response contains:
- `HTTP status code`: 3-digit codes used to indicate whether an HTTP request was successfully completed (1xx - Informational; 2xx Success; 3xx Redirection; 4xx Client Error; 5xx Server Error)
- `HTTP response headers`: Similar to an HTTP request header, contains important information such as language and format of data being sent. 
- `HTTP response body': Contains the requested information from the 'GET' requests within the HTTP request, commonly HTML data is sent to the client translating into a webpage

### Domain Name vs URL
Domain names are alphanumeric strings of text that map to an alphanumeric IP address. For example Google.com is a Domain Name but, with the help of DNS, it is translated into a numerical IP address (192.0.2.2) which is the actual address of the website. Domain Names are managed by domain registries, which delegate the reservation of domain names to registrars. 

A URL (Uniform Resource Locator), sometimes called a web address, is the complete path you see on a search engine. For example, w3schools.com is the domain name but https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables.asp is the URL, it contains the protocol (https) and the path (/python/python_variables.asp)

The section to the right of the last dot in a domain name is the TLD (top-level domain), they include the generic TLDs, such as:  ‘.com’, ‘.net’, ‘.org’, ‘.uk’ and ‘.jp’. To the left of the last dot is the 2LD (second-level domain) and anything to the left of that is the 3LD (third-level domain). For example:
`google.com`
- `.com` is the TLD
- `google` is the 2LD

`google.co.uk`
- `.uk` is the TLD
- `.co` is the 2LD
- `google` is the 3LD

### Hosting
A web server can refer to the computer that stores web server software and a webstie's component files (HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files). On the other hand, web server can also refer to the several parts that control how web users access hosted files. At a miniumum, this is an HTTP server that can be accessed through a domain name and deliver the websites content to the end user's device. 

Whenever a browser needs a file that is hosted on a web server, the browser requests the file via HTTP. When the request reaches the web server,it locates the document, and sends it back to the browser, via HTTP. If the server does not find the requested document, it returns a 404 response. 

A static web server, or stack, consists of a computer with an HTTP server. It is called a static web server because the server sends its hosted files as-is to your browser. On the other hand, a dynamic web server consists of a static web server plus extra software, typically an application server and database. It is called dynamic because the application server updates the hosted files before sending the content to your browser via the HTTP server. (For example the Wiki uses a couple HTML templates with a large database to present web pages, rather than thousands of static HTML documents for each Wiki page)

Hosting Files
A web server most store a website's files, namely HTML documents and its assets: images, CSS stylesheets, Javascript files, fonts, and video. For convenience it is recommended to host all the mentioned files on a dedicated web server, rather than on your PC, because:
- Web servers have more reliable up-time
- Web servers are rarely disconnected from the internet
- Web servers have a dedicated constant IP address
- Web servers are maintained by a third-party

### DNS
DNS resolution is when an IP address is translated from a domain name. Ways to find the IP address are through: the User's Computer Cache, DNS Cache, Hosts File, Recursive DNS Servers Cache (from ISP), Root DNS Servers TLDs, TLD Server Name Server, Authoritative Name Server Domain Info.
